## Stream Notes

So what are we doing here?

Two contexts:

* Interrupt Context
* App context

Additionally, we are going to be doing DMA, which means we need to have packets:

1. In RAM (nrf52 specific)
2. Data must be contiguous (because DMA)
3. Comms between contexts must be thread safe (because interrupts)
4. Data must have `'static` lifetime (mostly)

### Quick Primer on Heapless and BBQueue

`heapless::Queue<[0u8; 32], U10>`

| 32 bytes | 32 bytes | ..... | 32 bytes |

BUT if you have variable packet

`bbqueue` - really great for variable size chunks of u8 (bytes).

|        ONE BIG POOL OF BYTES           |
|   |           |     |      |        |  |
|               ]
|      ][                                ]

### What is our interface going to look like?

```text
   APP SIDE                IRQ SIDE
   ========                ========
   Some handle            Some Handle
   - send packet          - get outgoing packet
   - receive a packet     - shove incoming packet


         ====================> OUTGOING
         PRODUCER     CONSUMER

         <==================== INCOMING
         CONSUMER     PRODUCER
```

We need two BBQueues!

```rust
// Buffer for ESB, incoming queue is 1024 bytes, outgoing queue is 512 bytes
static BUFFER: EsbBuffer<U1024, U512> = EsbBuffer::new();

fn main() {
    let (mut app_esb, irq_esb) = EsbInterface::new(&BUFFER).unwrap();

    // somehow send `irq_esb` to the interrupt
    something(irq_esb);

    // Enable ESB or something?
    app_esb.init(...).unwrap();

    // TODO: What is a better interface?
    if auto_send { // DO this one
        // start the reception process
        let mut msg = app_esb.start_send().unwrap();

        // Fill the outgoing message
        msg[..8].copy_from_slice(&[10u8; 8]);

        // NOTE: This pends the RADIO interrupt too!
        msg.complete_send();
    } else {
        // start the reception process
        let mut msg = app_esb.start_push().unwrap();

        // Fill the outgoing message
        msg[..8].copy_from_slice(&[10u8; 8]);

        msg.finish_push();

        // Trigger send
        app_esb.start_tx();
    }


    // OR: Do we want

    // Wait for an incoming message
    while !app_esb.msg_ready() {
        continue;
    }

    // now we're not waiting
    let incoming = app_esb.get_incoming().unwrap();

    assert_eq!(&incoming[..8], &[11u8; 8]);
}

#[interrupt]
fn RADIO() {
    static mut STATE = ...;

    let esb_handle = something_get().unwrap();

    // Something with the radio?
    match STATE {
        State::Idle => {
            // check for outgoing?
        }
        State::WaitingForAck => {
            // check for incoming?
            // Maybe also a new outgoing?
            if got_ack() {
                push_into_queue()
                check_for_next()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
