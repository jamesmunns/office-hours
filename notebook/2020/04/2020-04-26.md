## Notice

This is the first Office Hours stream, but because I have to wait 24 hours before my first Live Stream on a new channel, this stream will be on my old channel. I plan to re-upload this stream to my new channel, once I can.

Please [subscribe to my new channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb48C4qqcXQpRugPbdwigZQ) so I can reserve a sweet URL!

    * My computer dropped some frames :(
2. Read up on the background info for ESB
    * Read the nordic docs
    * Read the nordic code

## Stream Notes

### Radio stuff!

* Nordic Chips
    * Support propietary protocol: Enhanced ShockBurst
    * SOME chips (like the 840) can do 802.15.4
        * Zigbee/Thread
* ESB
    * Hub and Spoke/Star topology
    * Central device:
        * Usually listens
        * Can include data on an ACK
    * Edge device(s):
        * Sends when it feels like it
        * Can listen for ACKs
    * Addresses and Pipes?
        * No idea yet
    * Turnaround for ACKs:
        * SUPER SHORT
        * Highest prio interrupts
        * Must preload messages

### Notes for next time:

* Review how PPI works in nRF52 Datasheet
* Review how the radio registers look (optional)
* Check in with Thales to see how code is going
* Start writing some example Rust code
* Before the stream:
    * Make sure I have two radios handy for testing
    * Set up a template rtfm/dwm1001 project for playgrounding
    * Have UART/logging handy already for testing
* On Monday:
    * Start writing some code!
    * Goal:
        * Getting LED remote control working
            * One device reading the button, being the PTX role
            * One device setting the LED, being the PRX role
        * Stretch goal:
            * Get a loopback going (offset by one packet)
            * Interval
