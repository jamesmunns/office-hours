## Post Show Summary:

* Tried to help justasec, not sure I did a good job :)
* Mostly got the bbqueue parts of ESB up and working!

## Stream Notes

### Justace

States of your machine

1. Idle
2. Receiving data
    * SS pin goes high
3. Received data, waiting to send
4. Sending data
5. Data sent (back to idle)


1. Receive Data
2. Complete Receive/Process Command
3. Begin Response
4. Complete Response, goto 1

* spi_complete:
    * NOT TRUE: fires every time the transaction has finished
    * TRUE: Line goes high every time


1. Buffer set up, DMA ready to go
2. SS goes low, DMA fills buffer
3. SS goes high, `spi_complete` is called
4. `spi_complete` releases buffer, pends `process_command`
5. `process_command`:
    * does some thinking
    * prepares a response
    * puts it in tx buffer
    * Makes DMA ready to go?
6. SS goes low, DMA drains buffer
7. SS goes high, `spi_complete` is called
8. ???


```rust
enum State {
    Receiving,
    Sending,
}

// in function
static mut STATE: State = State::Receiving;

let next_state = match STATE {
    Receiving => {
        // * mark busy
        // * read incoming dma
            // get the size
            // truncate method on the vec
        // * prepare response
        process_command(
            &cx.resources.incoming_slice[..rxed_bytes],
            &mut cx.resources.outgoing_vec,
        );

        // * prepare OUTGOING dma
        // * unmark busy
    }
    Sending => {
        // * prepare INCOMING dma

    }
}
// ...
```

// init
prepare INCOMING dma, mark ready

// spi_complete (totally sequential)
* When Receving
    * mark busy
    * read incoming dma
    * prepare response
    * prepare OUTGOING dma
    * unmark busy
* When done sending
    * prepare INCOMING dma

// in main
...........

waiting for incoming commands

### BBQueue usage profile

* UART

* push 12 bytes
* push 57 bytes
* push 33 bytes

OTHER SIDE

read <= 64 bytes
read <= 64 bytes


* Radio

all get pushed very quickly
* push packet
* push packet
* push packet

* push packet

relatively slowly
* pop packet

### BBQueue Notes

Thinking about payloads

* Outgoing
    * GrantW (app)
        * Obtain Grant
        * Fill the payload
        * Fill the header (based on len)
        * then commit
    * GrantR (radio)
        * Obtain Grant
        * Read the header
        * set bits
        * get ptr, give to DMA
        * DMA occurs.......
        * Release grant on completion
* Incoming
    * GrantW
        * Obtain Grant, NOT fill the header
        * get ptr, give to DMA
        * DMA occurs.......
        * get bits
        * Fill the header
        * commit (based on len)
    * GrantR
        * Obtain Grant
        * read data, header, whatever
        * Release grant
