# James' Office Hours

This is the tracking repository for James' Office Hours stream.

Check out the [stream on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb48C4qqcXQpRugPbdwigZQ)!

## Schedule

Right now I'm planning on streaming a couple days a week. I'll update this as I figure out what the cadence should be.

When I stream, it will probably be:

* Monday to Friday, 22:00 to 01:00
* Saturday to Sunday, Afternoonish (somewhere 18:30 to 21:30)

All times Europe/Berlin (currently CEST).

## Suggesting Topics

If you'd like to suggest a topic for me to work on or discuss on stream, feel free to [Open an Issue](https://github.com/jamesmunns/office-hours/issues/new)!

## Notes and Agenda

I keep all of my notes for previous and upcoming streams in the [notebook](./notebook/) folder, sorted by date. This notebook includes:

* Links to the stream (or the recording)
* Planned topics
* Notes from the streams

## Guests

I'm open to have guests on the stream! If you'd like to be a guest on the stream, please [Open an Issue](https://github.com/jamesmunns/office-hours/issues/new) and include what you'd like to talk about, and when you are available!
